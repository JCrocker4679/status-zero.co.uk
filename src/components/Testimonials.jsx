In doing so, Joe‚Äôs guidance has demystified the systems, processes, terminology and cultures involved and how my experience should be articulated to transcend such. It has been a painless and developmental experience, made so by the depth and breadth of Joe‚Äôs knowledge and emotionally intelligence approach to engagement. Joe‚Äôs ability to be succinct, straight talking and frank has been especially refreshing.',

Joe was amazing in his quick response to messages and arranging a zoom chat. I went into the zoom chat not really knowing what Joe could do for me, but left feeling proud of what I've achieved, excited for what I can bring to a new role and inspired to apply to jobs I had previously been too scared to apply to.",

Joe has helped me create a CV and to really understand the transferable skills that officers have in policing. Having been an officer himself he understood what I was trying to explain and expand on in regards to incidents and projects. Who knew all the things we do daily without giving a second thought to are great attributes to a business and actually how skilled and developed officer's really are!? If you are looking at leaving or just want to refresh an existing CV then I couldn't recommend Joe more highly.",
